temperaturesCGAG.csv: 'Global component of Climate at a Glance'

From the description at https://datahub.io/core/global-temp#readme

'Global temperature anomaly data come from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) data set and International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), which have data from 1880 to the present. These two datasets are blended into a single product to produce the combined global land and ocean temperature anomalies. The available timeseries of global-scale temperature anomalies are calculated with respect to the 20th century average.'

livingPlaneIndex.csv

From https://stats.livingplanetindex.org/latest_results

'The global Living Planet Index is the main indicator derived from our data. The Living Planet Index (LPI) is a measure of the state of the world's biological diversity based on population trends of vertebrate species from terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. The LPI has been adopted by the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) as an indicator of progress towards the post-2020 goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.'
